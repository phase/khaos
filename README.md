# Khaos
**Khaos** is a minigame API for Bukkit.

> In Greek mythology, Chaos or Khaos is the primeval state of existence from
  which the first gods appeared. In other words, the dark void of space. It is
  made from a mixture of what the Ancient Greeks considered the four elements:
  earth, air, water and fire. For example, when a log is burned, the flames
  were attributed to the fire in it, the smoke the air in it, the water and
  grease that come from it were supposed to be the water, and the ashes left
  over were the earth.
